# Introduction to Ruby on Rails
#
# Homework 03
#
# Purpose:
#
# Read the links below and complete the exercises in this file. This Lab
# is to help you better understand Arrays, Hashes and Loops that we
# learned in Lesson 03.
#
###############################################################################
#
# 1. Review your solution to Lab 02. Copy and Paste your solution to
#    this file.
#
# 2. Create a new Array variable called `set_of_numbers`, this will be
#    a range between 1 - 10 that our Player will guess from. Each value
#    in the Array should be an integer.
#
# 3. Change the variable `secret_number` (HW_02) so that instead of a hard-coded
#    Integer, it randomly chooses one of the options from `set_of_numbers`
#    ('secret_number' is the integer our Player will try to guess).
#
#      Hint: Look up Array#sample in the Ruby documentation.
#
# 4. Create a new Hash variable called `messages`. In this Hash will be
#    four Keys Value pairs:
#
#    1. :win - A String telling the Player that they have won.
#
#    2. :lose - A String telling the Player that they have lost and what
#       the correct number was.
#
#    3. :too_low - A String telling the Player that their guess was too
#       low.
#
#    4. :too_high - A String telling the Player that their guess was too
#       high.
#
# 5. Change the behavior of your program, so instead of hard coding, use the principles of DRY(don't repeat yourself). 
#    This means using a Loop to iterate over your code either until the Player has guessed the
#    correct number, or they have tried to guess 3 times.
#
# 6. Make sure to comment your code so that you have appropriate
#    documentation for you and for the TAs grading your homework. :-)

	user_guess = gets.strip.to_i
	# gets the users guess
	puts "count:#{count}\nnum_guesses: #{num_guesses}"

	if count+1 == num_guesses && !is_secret_num(user_guess, secret_number)
		# checks to see if the user has run out of guesses.  The minus one is to account for count starting at 0.
		puts "#{messages[:lose]}#{messages[:answer]}"
		break

	elsif is_secret_num(user_guess, secret_number)
		# checks to see if the user guessed the secret number
		puts "#{messages[:win]} #{messages[:answer]}"
		break

	elsif user_guess > secret_number
		#checks to see if the users guess is to high
		puts "#{messages[:too_high]}"

	elsif user_guess < secret_number
		#checks to see if teh users guess is to low
		puts "#{messages[:too_low]}"

	else
		#checks to see if the input is invalid
		puts "#{messages[:error]}"
	end
end

puts "Thanks for playng!"
